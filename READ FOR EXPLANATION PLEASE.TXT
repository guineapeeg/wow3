in this assignment i implented 
1. granular locks (locks each position in output array)
2. global lock

regarding local locks, i understood it as a requirement to implement a program that creates several threads, each thread get assigned some ammount of files, and there are two 
ways to read data from a file:
1. all threads read their assigned files concurrently
2. threads read theit files in order, for example, thread 1 reads k bytes of files assigned to it, then thread 2 reads k bytes of files assigned to it, etc...

i output all numbers in the file output as floats

assumed beta and alpha arguments will be provided for every file in metadata file, and metadata structure like i have it is important for execution

i wasnt sure if  program was supposed to exit

all arrays and etc are not dynamic, and are implemented in some constant size

worked with text files provided

output file gets updated after each run
